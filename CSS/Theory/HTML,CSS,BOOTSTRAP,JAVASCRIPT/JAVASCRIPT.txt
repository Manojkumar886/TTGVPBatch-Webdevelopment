JavaScript is one of the 3 languages all web developers must learn:

   1. HTML to define the content of web pages

   2. CSS to specify the layout of web pages

   3. JavaScript to program the behavior of web pages

Java Script
-------------
--->Java script is used by programmers across the world to create a 
      dynamic and interactive web content like browsers and applications.
--->Easy to implement into standard html code...
--->Data Types are number,string,boolean,object,function

JavaScript display possibilities
-------------------------------------
* alert()				-The alert() method displays an alert box with a message and an OK button.
					 The alert() method is used when you want information to come through to the user.

* document.write()	-The write() method writes directly to an open (HTML) document stream.
					  writeln() adds a newline character after each statement. write() does not.
					  The writeln() method is identical to the write() method, with the addition of writing a newline character
					  (U+000A) after each statement.

* console.log			-The console. log() is a function in JavaScript that is used to print any kind of variables defined befor e in 
					  it or to just print any message that needs to be displayed to the user

JavaScript Keywords
-------------------------
	Javascript users can declare a variable using 3 keywords.that are let,var,const.

Var				-	The var keyword is used in all JavaScript code from 1995 to 2015.
					If you want your code to run in older browsers, you must use var.

Let and Const 	-	The let and const keywords were added to JavaScript in 2015.

Const 			-  	Always declare a variable with const when you know that the value should not be changed.

Functions
------------
A js functions is a block of code designed to perform a particukar task.(function and fat arrow function)
fat arrow function 	-Arrow functions allow us to use the fat arrow => operator to quickly define JavaScript functions, with or without parameters.
1)	function fucntionname()								2)   keyword functioname=()=>
	{														{
	//statement													//statment
	}														}


InnerHtml
------------
	the innerhtml property sets or return the html content of an element[innerhtml].
	<button type="button" onclick="document.getelementbyid('process').innerhtml=Date()"</button>
	<p id="process"></p>

Array in JavaScript
-----------------------
*array is a special variable ,which can hold the more than one value.
*Dynamic storage and fast,Secure.
*using an array litreally is easiest way to cretae an java script[two]
	keyword variablename=squarebrackets[];==>let points=[23,54,34,23,45,45];
	keyword variablename=new Array();==>const points=new Array(assigned values);
	ARRAY CRUDL METHODS
	------------------------------------
	Push()	- In this method adds a new element to an array(at the end point)
	Pop()	- The pop() method removes a last element from an array
	length()	- The length property provides an easy way to guess a list of element
	filter()	- the method create a new array filled with element that is pass a test provided by functions
			   [update,delete a prticular index]
	map()	- the map() method is creates a new array from calling a function for every array element


REGULAR EXPRESSION
---------------------------------
-->it is a sequance of charcter that forms a search patterns.
-->the search pattern can be usedfor text searcg and text replace operations is called regular expressions.
RegExp Object
A regular expression is a pattern of characters.
kThe pattern is used to do pattern-matching "search-and-replace" functions on text.

Patterns matching process- TEST-test()	Tests for a match in a string. Returns true or false
	
Expression	Description
[abc]		Find any character between the brackets A-Z
[ 	 	]		Find any character NOT between the brackets
[0-9]		Find any character between the brackets (any digit)
[^0-9]		Find any character NOT between the brackets (any non-digit)
(x|y)			Find any of the alternatives specified

Quantifiers-
[min,max] 	- minimun to maximum
[min, .]		-minimun count maximum unlimited
char	 *		-either or condition
char +		-atleast one
$/			-$ means "Match the end of the string" (the position after the last character in the string).
^			-^ matches the starting of the sentence.
@			-@ matches itself.

Basic Validation 			− 	First of all, the form must be checked to make sure all the mandatory fields are filled in. 
							It would require just a loop through each field in the form and check for data.

Data Format Validation 	− 	Secondly, the data that is entered must be checked for correct form and value. 
						Your code must include appropriate logic to test correctness of data
